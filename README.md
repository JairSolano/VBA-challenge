Data analytic bootcamp
module 2 challenge
Jair Solano

This is my solution for the challenge of module 2. 

First focused on the ticker and the total volume.
Then found the open price per ticker to determine values of stock change and percent change.

Then added some conditional formating and added the headers for the summary table.

Added the functionality to the sheets. 

Lastly looped through all the sheets in worksheet.
