Hello, this is my submittal for challenge 2, multiple year stock data. 

It was a fun activity, mainly because it reviewed what was learned during class and challenge 
my analytic skill beyond the classroom. I was able to use some resources, I used a tutor to explain
functions I was challenged with. 

Thank you.
